## 1. Project Setup:
* Set up a Java project using your preferred IDE (e.g., Eclipse, IntelliJ) or a build tool like Maven or Gradle.
* Ensure JavaFX 17 is correctly configured for your GUI development.

## 2. API Integration:
* Familiarize yourself with making HTTP requests in Java (using java.net.http.HttpClient or similar).
* Explore the GraphQL-Pokemon API and Type Effectiveness API documentation to understand the required request formats and expected responses.

## 3. Basic Application Structure:
* Create the main application class extending from javafx.application.Application.
* Set up the primary stage with a basic layout (using javafx.scene.layout classes like BorderPane, VBox, HBox).
* Develop a simple GUI with placeholders for the key features (e.g., Pokémon selection, battle simulation area).
  
## 4. API Data Retrieval:
* Implement methods to retrieve data from the APIs.
* Parse the JSON responses using a library like Gson.
* Develop utility classes/models to represent Pokémon, moves, types, etc.
  
## 4. Core Features Implementation:
* Create functionality for users to select Pokémon and moves.
* Implement the battle logic considering type effectiveness, moves, and stats.
* Add features for simulating the battle and displaying the outcome.
  
## 5. Testing and Debugging:
* Regularly test each component of your application.
* Debug issues as they arise and ensure the application aligns with project requirements.

## 6. Enhancements and Polishing:
* Enhance the user interface for a better user experience.
* Add additional features like the educational component or strategic planning feature.
* Refine code structure, comments, and documentation.
  
## 7. Final Steps:
Thoroughly test the entire application.
Ensure compliance with all project requirements, especially non-functional ones.
Prepare for submission according to the guidelines provided.
